### Final Predictions and Business Applications

Our predictive models demonstrated exceptional performance in estimating property prices, particularly with the use of Random Forest, which excelled across both the light and heavy datasets. The model achieved near-perfect predictions in the light dataset with an R² of 1.00, indicating it captured all the variability in the data. For the more complex heavy dataset, Random Forest still performed admirably with an R² of 0.7918, proving its robustness in handling non-linear relationships and large volumes of data. These models provide a solid foundation for real estate stakeholders, offering powerful insights into pricing trends based on property features such as location, size, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics. By leveraging these models, real estate agents, brokers, and property developers can more accurately assess property values, make informed decisions, and enhance their market strategies.

However, while the current models provide strong results, there are clear areas for improvement. First, the deep learning model, which was tested but underperformed, highlights the need for further development in this area. Deep learning models, while promising, require more extensive data preprocessing, better hyperparameter tuning, and larger datasets to compete with classical machine learning models like Random Forest. Additionally, incorporating more advanced NLP capabilities into the chatbot prototype will allow it to handle more complex queries and seamlessly integrate machine learning predictions into its responses. This can significantly enhance the chatbot’s ability to provide real-time, personalized recommendations based on user inputs, creating a more engaging and efficient user experience.

The deployed model can be a game-changer for businesses in the real estate industry. It can be utilized in pricing tools for property listings, helping real estate agents and investors determine accurate listing prices and identify market trends. The model’s ability to predict property values based on multiple factors, including school quality, neighborhood trends, and property features, can provide competitive advantages in a crowded market. Additionally, the AI-powered chatbot, once fully developed, can act as an intelligent assistant for customers, answering questions, providing property recommendations, and offering dynamic price estimations. This combination of advanced machine learning and AI chatbots can streamline the real estate process, improving client interactions, speeding up decision-making, and increasing overall satisfaction.
